# Session 10

## üìñ Overview

In Today's session we concluded our cloud deployment journey.

We started by expanding our knowledge about the cloud and deployment.

Then we learned about the inner-workings of Elastic Beanstalk and the steps it takes.

Afterwards we learned about the popular CI/CD platform. Learning what it is and how does it work.

And then we took a step back and took a general look and we learned how to approach an application for CI/CD.

We understood all the steps we need to go from source code to production and created all the necessary scripts.

We then started creating our CircleCI script and learned about Orbs and Jobs and how to use them to apply our deployment steps.

We finally finished our CircleCI script, deployed the our projects and troubleshot most common issues that come from a CI/CD pipeline.

For today's bonus content we learned how to create diagrams of our infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline for software documentation purposes.
